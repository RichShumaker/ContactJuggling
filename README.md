ContactJuggling
===============
the inContactJugglingDotCom is 4 sites in one.
It uses TiddlyWiki as the underlying technology.
TiddlyWiki is a self contained Wiki so each of the 4 pages is it's own world(HTML Page).
The 4 pages are

Landing.html
Watch.html
Learn.html
Collect.html

ContactJugglingDotCom is unusual as it allows anyone to download any of the 4 pages and run with it in their own direction.
Like a pick your own adventure book where you can modify the adventure.

These pages are put on Github to allow people the power of GIT to contribute to the site.
In the past different method for contributing were created and many of them did not work because of hacking or some other issue.
Now anyone can hack away on their own copy and at the same time contribute to the group, win win.

Ideally the HTML all in one could be broken into individual pages each with the ability to be updated and modified.
Until then we can adapt the HTML pages and keep the data flowing.
