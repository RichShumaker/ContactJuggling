ContactJuggling
===============

This Git Respository is to help expand Contact Juggling.<br>
The repository includes the Main TiddlyWiki's for ContactJugglingDotCom<br>

ContactJugglingDotCom is 4 sites in one.<br>
It uses TiddlyWiki as the underlying technology.<br>
TiddlyWiki is a self contained Wiki(HTML File_ so each of the 4 pages is it's own world.<br>
The 4 pages are<br><br>

Landing.html<br>
Watch.html<br>
Learn.html<br>
Collect.html<br><br>

ContactJugglingDotCom is unusual as it allows anyone to download any of the 4 pages and run with it in their own direction.<br>
Like a pick your own adventure book where you can modify the adventure.<br><br>

These pages are put on Github to allow people the power of GIT to contribute to the site.<br>
In the past different method for contributing were created and many of them did not work because of hacking or some other issue.<br>
Now anyone can hack away on their own copy and at the same time contribute to the group, win win.<br><br>

In the future the all in one HTML pages will be broken into individual pages each with the ability to be updated and modified.<br>
Until then we can adapt the HTML pages and keep the data flowing.<br>
