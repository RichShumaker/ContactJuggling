#Tossing
Typically not considered part of Contact Juggling, that does not mean it is not.<BR>
In order to have tossing as part of Contact Juggling it needs to stay 'in contact' with your mind.<BR>
So a blind throw is actually Contact Juggling.

This is the third type of movement or primary movement that I break Contact Juggling into.
