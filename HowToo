Need to clean this up.<BR>
I use 3 different ways to both edit and save TW files(I call TiddlyWiki my Dream Machine as it allows me to reach my Dreams)<BR>
Also learning how to use Git so things are kinda messy right now.

3 Ways
Server with a special PHP file, need to find that na dlink it
TiddlyDesktop
Special Browser Save - This has security issues and is why I have switched to TiddlyDesktop


This is a How Too File for how to use the HTML files in this repository<BR><BR>
<BR>
THey are TiddlyWiki Files http://www.tiddlywiki.com and as such have different ways to interact with them.<BR>
These are the 4 HTML files that are the basis for CJdC.<BR>
They are each individual ideas of who would be using the data and therefore tailored to them.<BR>
In the future we will break the HTML into individual pages and this will avony potential overlaps and also make a more unified 'code' base.
It is easy to simply download my TW and put it in your system and for you to use it.<BR>

Currently I find TiddlyDesktop the best way for me to interact with these files as many of the 'saving' options from browsers have been found to be problematic because of security issues.
The other way I interact with this data is via a server. I create a Raspberry Pi server and use the code(need to find it) to allow me to upload directly from the Tiddlywiki
