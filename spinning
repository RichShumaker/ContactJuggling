#Spinning
So if Rolling is one side then spinning is the other.<BR>
Many people will say what about this or that and I usually say that those things are not a movement method but a technique.<BR>
The primary one that comes to mind that is typically broken out is isolation<BR>
###You Can Isolate Anything
And as such it is not a movement method but a method by which you move.  You can create an isolated spin, or isolated roll, or you can isolate a chair.<BR>
##So what are isolation then?
A technique like falling up or no look throws or stalls.  They are not a form but can create a style.  By form I am referring to a primary way of movement and not 'forms'.<BR>
'forms' are more often called styles.  Your style uses a lot of isolations.
